Run wingetcreate:
    winget cannot run against a local file. also when you run winget using a local manifest for testing winget 
    must be able to download the installer from a URL. so we need a release in github before we can go forward.

    wingetcreate.exe new https://github.com/dk107dk/flightpath_server/releases/download/v0.0.1-alpha/FlightPathServer-arm64-test.msix

    the manifest is written here: 
        C:\dev\flightpath_packaging\winget\manifests\a\AtestaAnalytics\FlightPathServer\1.1.15.0    

    validate it with: 
        winget validate --manifest c:\dev\flightpath_packaging\winget\manifests\a\AtestaAnalytics\FlightPathServer\1.1.15.0
    
    test the install with:
        winget install --manifest c:\dev\flightpath_packaging\winget\manifests\a\AtestaAnalytics\FlightPathServer\1.1.15.0    

The identities in the MSIX and cert must match exactly.
    certutil -dump assets\FlightPathCert.pfx

Run 1x as admin to allow local manifest installs: 
    winget settings --enable LocalManifestFiles

Compute SHA256 in powershell: 
    Get-FileHash .\FlightPathServer-arm64-v0.0.1.msix -Algorithm SHA256



Github releases: 
    - created manually
    - need a test msix that is signed in order to test the installer and winget
